Additional features include credit history, number of finance inquiries, address including zip codes, and state, and collections among others. It is quite rich and is an excellent example of credit risk data.  Interestingly, Goldman Sachs’ new peer-to-peer lending platform called Marcus was built almost entirely using the Lending Club data.\n",
